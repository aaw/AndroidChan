Look at .classpath for the lib dependencies you'll need to build.

Search for "!!!" to find anything that you'll need to replace in order to build
your own client app. You'll also want to name it something different from
"com.androidchan.client" if you want to put it on the Android market, since
that name needs to be unique.
