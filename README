AndroidChan

An imageboard for android. This code is essentially the client and server code
for MobileChan (https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mobilechan.client)

Beware, the Android client code is pretty rough and you should treat it as a
proof-of-concept. It works, but it was my first shot at programming Android...

This code is all released under the WTFPL (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL)
